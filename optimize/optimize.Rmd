*Abstract.* The method of one-dimensional optimization is explained in the context of capillary waves.

**1. Introduction.**

R provides functions for both one-dimensional and multi-dimensional optimization.  The second topic is much more complicated than the former (see e.g. Nocedal 1999) and will be left for another day.

A convenient function for 1D optimization is ``optimize()``, also known as ``optimise()``.  Its first argument is a function whose minimum (or maximum) is sought, and the second is a two-element vector giving the range of values of the independent variable to be searched.  (See ``?optimize`` for more.)

**2. Application.**

As an example, consider the phase speed of deep gravity-capillary waves, which is given by $\omega/k$ where $\omega$ is the frequency and $k$ is the wavenumber, and the two are bound together with the dispersion relationship $omega^2=gk+\sigma k^3/\rho$, where $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity, $\sigma$ is the surface tension parameter (0.074 N/m for an air-water interface) and $\rho$ is the water density (1000 kg/m^3 for fresh water).  This yields wave speed given by the following R function.


```{r}
phaseSpeed <- function(k)
{
    g <- 9.8
    sigma <- 0.074                     # water-air
    rho <- 1000                        # fresh water
    omega2 <- g * k + sigma * k^3 / rho
    sqrt(omega2) / k
}
```

Readers with a background in the topic of waves may know that there is a minimum phase speed at wavelengths of about 2 cm, or a $k$ of approximately $2\pi/0.02$ which is about 300.  It always makes sense to plot a function to be optimized, if only to check that it has been coded correctly, so that's the next step.

```{r}
k <- seq(100, 1000, length.out=100)
par(mar=c(3, 3, 1, 1), mgp=c(2, 0.7, 0))
plot(k, phaseSpeed(k), type="l", xlab="Wavenumber", ylab="Phase speed")
```

The results suggest that the range of $k$ illustrate contains the minimum, so we provide that to ``optimize()``.

```{r}
o <- optimize(phaseSpeed, range(k))
phaseSpeed(o$minimum)
```

This speed is not especially fast; it would take about a heartbeat to move past your hand.

**3. Exercises**

1. Use ``str(o)`` to learn about the contents of the optimized solution.

2. Use ``abline()`` to indicate the wavenumber at the speed minimum.

3. Try other functions that are of interest to you.

4. Use the multi-dimensional optimizer named ``optim()`` on this problem.
